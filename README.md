# Commandler Example [![Discord][discord-members]][discord] [![GitLab Pipeline Status][gitlab-build]][gitlab] [![Coverage][gitlab-coverage]][gitlab] 

## About
This is an example project which creates a minimal console application
using [Commandler][commandler]. This intends to use all features of Commandler and so will depend
on all modules.

**This project is not intended for deployment and so should only be run in development.  
It's just a way to have a vanilla example while making an integration test.**

## Open-Source
This project is licenced under the Apache 2.0 project, don't be afraid to take whatever code
from this project you want to aid you in your project!

## Support
Should any problems occur, come visit us over on [Discord][discord]! We're always around and
there are ample developers that would be willing to help; if it's a problem with the library
itself then we'll make sure to get it sorted.
